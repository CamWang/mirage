    content: `For months, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) has decried former president Donald Trump’s false claims of massive election fraud — a stance that cost her a leadership position in the House earlier this month.

But when pressed on Sunday about whether Trump’s falsehoods were the cause of Republican moves to pass restrictive new voting laws in dozens of states, Cheney disputed the suggestion.

“I think you have to look at the specifics of each one of those efforts,” Cheney said on “Axios on HBO,” arguing that some of the bills had been misrepresented.`,

    content: `Don’t want to splurge on the Apple AirPods or the Samsung Galaxy Buds? We hear you. While both those models deliver premium audio and top-notch design, they cost upwards of $100. Thankfully, we stumbled upon a pair of top-rated wireless earbuds for a fraction of that ...with features that even AirPods and Galaxy Buds don’t have!

Enter the Edyell Wireless Earbuds, a wallet-friendly pair with impressive audio quality and deep, satisfying bass. And here’s the best part: They’re on sale for just $15 with on-page coupon, down from $28. That’s nearly half off!

And if you have Amazon Prime, you’ll get free shipping, of course. Not yet a member? No worries; you can sign up for a free 30-day trial here. (And by the way, those without Prime still get free shipping on orders of $25 or more.)

The Edyell Wireless Earbuds offer up to 120 hours of playtime with their included charging case. To put a finer point on it: You can get over 25 charges before you have to plug them in again! And how's this for a twist? That same charging case can also be used as a power bank for other devices — you can charge your smartphone or tablet with it via USB. Now that’s something Apple AirPods just can’t do.`,

    title: "Original Xbox Dashboard Easter Egg Discovered After 20 Years",
    subtitle: "As reported by website Kotaku, an anonymous developer of the original Xbox leaks the steps to trigger an undiscovered dashboard Easter Egg.",
    author: "Caleb Greer",

    content: `A new Easter Egg has been discovered in the original Xbox's dashboard, nearly twenty years after the console's initial release. Microsoft's first Xbox, which launched back in November 2001, is known to contain many hidden secrets within its operating system.

Indeed, one such secret in the Xbox dashboard was discovered years ago. To initiate that Easter Egg, a player must press "Music" from the main menu and insert an audio CD. From the "Audio CD" menu, the player presses "Copy" before selecting "Copy" once again on the next screen. The player then selects "New Soundtrack." If everything is done correctly, a keyboard should come up with a space to name the soundtrack. Spelling out "<<Eggsβox>>" and selecting "Done" activates a credits screen that thanks the development team and lists the original Xbox developers.

The existence of the latest Easter Egg, as well as the steps needed to activate it, were leaked by an anonymous source to website Kotaku, who verified the source as an original Xbox developer. Reporter Alexandra Hall inquired as to why the source decided to leak this information now. Aside from believing that the Easter Egg would never be found since it hadn't been discovered in twenty years, the source said, "I also thought if I didn’t do it now it would never likely happen. It had been so long I couldn’t even remember the trigger!" The source had to verify that they still knew the trigger by trying out "several things" on their Xbox to be certain. Kotaku's video on how to activate the Easter Egg can be viewed below.

The steps to activate the new Easter Egg are very similar to the steps required to activate the older Easter Egg described earlier. Both are triggered by going through the process to rip a CD and entering a specific series of characters into the field. Therefore, players need only follow the steps outlined earlier to reach the "New Soundtrack" naming screen. From there, the phrase and obvious South Park reference "Timmyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!" must be entered in the field (it has twenty-six "y"s). Press "Done," wait for the CD to rip, then navigate back to the main menu. If the player then selects "Settings," scrolls down, and chooses "System Info," the text there will have changed to display the four names of the original Xbox Dashboard Team: Victor Blanco, Sakphong Chanbai, Bradford Christian, and Jim Helm.`,
